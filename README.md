asphorisms
==========

Collaborative spec for a new set of aspirational aphorisms or "asphorisms" to post on the walls of offices full of people using computers.

So far, the most common high-level instructions we give to ourselves while working have been [written haphazardly](http://xkcd.com/1428/), distributed by [fads](http://www.keepcalmandcarryon.com/) and memes, and often reflect an [unexamined position](http://gizmodo.com/5878987/its-official-google-is-evil-now) in the society the authors claim to be helping make into a [better place](http://youtu.be/J-GVd_HLlps?t=37s).

This project is an attempt to create an open source set of new asphorisms, collaboratively written to reflect a set of ideas we and the people who use our work can live with. The first release will be considered Asphorisms 2.0
