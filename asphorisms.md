Asphorisms 1.0.1
---------------------------------
##Giving you the doubt to drive self-improvement

"Asphorism" is a portmantau of "apsirational" and "aphorism". Aphorisms make you feel better about your work without having to do anything. 

This is a project to establish a deliberate and critically aware set of asphorisms to replace the ad-hoc set that has made its way onto the walls and t-shirts of the contemporary workforce, especially in the tech community. For example, "Move Fast and Break Things" works well for those with freedom of movement and spare things, but that type of work is not inherently better than work done by confined and impoverished workers. Putting "Keep Calm and Carry On" on anything does not make you quaint, cute, or clever, and should not happen, ever.

Needing less always beats having more

Tools that don't plug in last longer than those that do

Ask better questions

No teachers without books, no books without teachers

Freedom means free time. Anyone who tells you different wants you to be their slave

Work is hard when it dehumanizes you

The helping matrix are the conditions that form the four kinds of helping

| What you are doing | Its effect on the situation | 
| -------------------| --------------------------- |
| helping            | helpful                     |
| not-helping        | not helpful                 |
